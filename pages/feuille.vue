        Feuille

        Feuille is a tool that combines a lot of modules that can be open or close. Feuille goals is to provide many parts that can be useful for the anime and drama. Its focus is simplicity. Historic modules from AssFxMaker are Karaoke, ASS Drawing and Scripting coding to use with karaoke presets. Here comes also new modules based on progress of AssFxMaker as Feuille specific module which is ASS comparison and yggdrasil modules, that are for the future, which are ASS Table, OCR...

Karaoke use presets and your own templates with or without use of scripting. The presets are elements to choose before writing a template. There are 4 usable presets:

    Basic -> you use it to do a simple karaoke line.
    Period -> you use it to do a karaoke line that use at least two templates which loop.
    Random -> you use it to do a karaoke line that use at least two templates randomly chosen.
    Symmetric -> you use it to do a karaoke line that use at least two templates mirrored in the center of your line.

The Scripting part of AssFxMaker is now including in karaoke templates dialog.

ASS Drawing offers simple way to create a drawing using tool to create lines or curves, using layers to do a better design according dimension. You can also use transformations as translation, rotation and scaling. The possibilities are not finished so I let you try it by yourself.

ASS Comparison offers way to view what are the changes between to scripts visually.

ASS Table is a simple tool to open, save, create, modify an ASS script.

Video lets you see a video file (but lacks of subtitles display for the moment).

Audio lets you time your ASS events (but still in progress, maybe done in the future).

OCR try to get text from your video (but still in progress, maybe done in the future).
